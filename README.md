This is the development assignment for Ask Phill

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Assignment
Make a filter with the stack we use in such a way that we can filter big inventories and it doesn't affect performance even if it would have 2000+ products.

## Requirements

1. We need to have the possibility to filter
    - . Color(color family name)
    - . Price(price range between x and x)
    - . Category tags(for example sandals, mid-heels, etc)
2. Use Next, Gatsby or CRA (if you want to impress? use our current stack)
3. Use pagination so not all products are loaded at once
4. All the filters need to accept multiple parameters
5. The user should be able to combine the filter parameters together
6. Styling is not required (if you want to style the filter here is an example design, only price
filter not included)
7. All ideas and concepts are welcome, this assignment would be a perfect reflection of the
task and responsibilities at Ask Phill. What is always important for us is that it is: performant, easy to maintain, scalable and reusable.
